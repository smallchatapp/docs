We create a private channel so that you can manage who has access to reply to Smallchat messages. In the future we may add support for public channels.</p>\\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must have permissions to create private channels in order to setup Smallchat.

You can change this behavior to only show your team’s icon in the Avatar settings.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"visibility\\\">Visibility</h2>\\n<p>The Smallchat messenger will show up on any page where you embed the script. If you put Smallchat on a static site then you can hide the widget by simply removing the script. However, if you’re embedding Smallchat in a template file or for web app, the script will load for multiple pages. To hide Smallchat in this scenario, simply type in the urls where it should not be visible.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"assets/visibility.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>For example, inside the dashboard we hide the messenger when you’re on Appearance settings so that the preview doesn’t cause confusion.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"operating-hours\\\">Operating Hours</h2>\\n<p>At Smallchat, our goal is to lower the barrier between you and your customers.

If you put Smallchat on a static site then you can hide the widget by simply removing the script. However, if you’re embedding Smallchat in a template file or for web app, the script will load for multiple pages. To hide Smallchat in this scenario, simply type in the urls where it should not be visible.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"assets/visibility.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>For example, inside the dashboard we hide the messenger when you’re on Appearance settings so that the preview doesn’t cause confusion.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"operating-hours\\\">Operating Hours</h2>\\n<p>At Smallchat, our goal is to lower the barrier between you and your customers. By default anyone can send a message at any time. However, not everyone can provide support 24/7 so you can set operating hours to turn the messenger offline. Once you have enables this feature you&#39;ll have the option to set your time zone, set daily online hours, or toggle off entire days.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"assets/operatinghours.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>By default being offline mode does not hide the messenger completely, it only triggers an offline message which you can configure in the appearance settings. You can change this behavior to hide the messenger when you’re offline.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"assets/offline.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"appearance\\\">Appearance</h2>\\n<p>You can configure the messenger to match your brand and voice. The easiest way to do this is to change the brand color and text color settings under Appearance.</p>\\n<p>Additionally you can select the launcher type to fit your needs. There are three different types of launcher buttons, each one carefully designed with a custom animation.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"assets/launchers.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Note: Smallchat launcher and messenger open from the bottom right corner. To change its position you can apply custom css to the top-level element by selecting <code>#Smallchat</code>.  We may add this functionality in the future.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pro Plan</strong>: If you’re on the Pro Plan you can remove the “powered by Smallchat” link at the bottom of every messenger.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"assets/poweredby.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"messaging-and-prompts\\\">Messaging and Prompts</h2>\\n<p>You can configure any message or prompt on the messenger. Yes, that includes localizing the language too. Smallchat provides default messages in English.</p>\\n<p>As you replace messages you can preview what it’ll look like in the messenger as you type:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"assets/preview.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"user-data\\\">User Data</h2>\\n<p>Smallchat can collect user information for you, including their name and email.
